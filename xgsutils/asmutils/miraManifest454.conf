# Example for a manifest describing a denovo assembly with
# unpaired 454 data

# First part: defining some basic things
# In this example, we just give a name to the assembly
#  and tell MIRA it should map a genome in accurate mode

project = DenovoAssembly
job = genome,denovo,accurate

# The second part defines the sequencing data MIRA should load and assemble
# The data is logically divided into "readgroups"

# here's the 454 data

readgroup = sample
data = ../ls454_reads.fastq
